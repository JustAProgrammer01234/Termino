To begin using me, first type a $ dollar then type the command you want to execute
Like for example:

$testcommand <parameters>

List of commands:
1. copy (Which copies your message after the command.)
2. randomnum (Which takes in parameters start and stop.) 
3. add (Type the numbers you want to add next to the command.)
4. helpme (Basically shows this message lol.)
5. help (A more professional way to know about me.....)
